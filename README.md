 Information System Development with Data Flow Diagrams, IDEF1x, and UML Diagrams

This project focuses on the development of an **Information System (IS)** with the creation of various models and diagrams to represent the system's architecture, processes, and interactions. The system development includes **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)** at zero and first levels, **IDEF1x model**, **Class Diagrams**, **Activity Diagrams**, **Use Case Diagrams**, and **Sequence Diagrams** to visually represent the system's structure and behavior.

## Features:
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**: Representation of the system’s data flow at the zero level (context diagram) and first level (expanded processes).
- **IDEF1x Model**: A data modeling technique used to represent the system’s entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **Class Diagram**: A diagram that shows the static structure of the system, including the system’s classes and their relationships.
- **Activity Diagram**: A diagram that illustrates the dynamic behavior of the system, focusing on workflows and activities.
- **Use Case Diagram**: A diagram that shows the interactions between users (actors) and the system's use cases.
- **Sequence Diagram**: A diagram that shows how objects interact with each other in a specific sequence of events.

## Technologies Used:
- **Modeling Language**: UML (Unified Modeling Language)
- **Data Modeling**: IDEF1x
- **Diagramming Tools**: Microsoft Visio
